#Test for BigLight

*Main objective*:

The requirement for this brief is to take the accompanying design and code it in to a 

responsive web page. It is up to the candidate what technologies they use and how 

they structure their files. Their approach to the brief will be considered.

The layout and design is not the main focus, but the candidate should consider 

device compatibility and that it renders correctly. If needed, the layout can be 

adjusted to accommodate technical/responsive challenges but if so it should be 

documented as to why.

*Key requirements*:

The candidate is free to decide how much depth they go in to their code, but the 

following are a must.

+ Be responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop

+ Consider cross browser compatibility

+ Be organised and have high code readability

+ Load more content (content can be repeated)

*Nice to have*:

The following are open to how much depth the candidate goes in to, but the more 

that is done can be advantageous for assessing skills. For example, coding one social 

feed and using dummy content for the rest.

+ A real social feed pulling through in the letâ€™s be social sidebar

+ Sharing button to share dummy content

*Delivery*

There are 2 ways the candidate can deliver the files

+ Zipped up and sent via email/file transfer

+ Hosted on a server for viewing and accompanying assets sent separately if any
